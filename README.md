# aboutme
This is the about me web site assigned to me by Codaisseur Academy before my training, as a means to introduce myself to my classmates.

## Technologies Used
In order to implement this project I used VS Code and basic HTML and Sass for the looks and feels of the website. No Javascript was used 
during the development of this website

## Development
In order to build the website I used Adobe XD to design the website look and feel. For the development I used the Gitflow 
standards principles. A develop branch was used for all the development and a Features branch was added for all the individual 
components designed. Finally, a Releases branch was created for the website with tag 1.0 as the current version. Any future features
will be implemented the same way

## Deployment
The deployment process used is based on Azure DevOps using standard CI. As soon as a release is published to the master branch
AzureDev ops CI is triggered automatically to copy the files to Azure using FTPS.
