                    My name is Billy, I am 32 years old with a background in full stack development. 
                    I have spent over 8 years developing web applications with some experience in 
                    mobile apps. I have also spent some time developing games in Unity, mainly 
                    working on a personal project that focuses on procedurally generating a whole 
                    universe and planets. I've also spent two years as an instructor and therapist 
                    at a hypnotherapy institute and four years as a professional dance instructor.

                                One of my greatest passions is traveling and discovering the world. 
                                I've already travelled to many places and am looking forward to 
                                seeing some more!

                                Coding has always been a hobby, a way to relax and chill after a 
                                very busy day doing what I (mostly) hated. From web apps to game 
                                design, I can compare coding to creative meditating!
                            </p>

                                when you don't create things, you become defined by your tastes 
                                rather than ability. your tastes only narrow & exclude people. 
                                so create!

                                Music is life! Dancing is expression! From commercial and latin 
                                to techno and hardstyle. You can find me in most dancing festivals 
                                and dance events doing what I like.
                            </p>
